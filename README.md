# SeqData -- Annotated biological sequence data
Several core workflows in machine learning for biological sequence analysis remain inaccessible due to the difficulty in preparing ML algorithm-ready datasets and the fragmented nature of the set of tools that exist to help. SeqData is a Python library that provides a unified interface for reading, writing, and manipulating annotated biological sequence data using XArray and Zarr. SeqData is designed to be used in conjunction with other libraries in the PyData ecosystem, such as scikit-learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow, as well as with EUGENe and other libraries for biological sequence analysis.

See the [documentation](https://seqdata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information.
